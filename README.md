# Pawn_Talk
A place to have a chat and play a game of chess

This project is a real-time chess and chat application utilizing web sockets. Enter the room name of your choice on the landing page. If your room choice is not being used then you will be asked to enter your username. Once you have entered your username you can send a link to the room to anyone you like.  Once they arrive you may have a chat and play a game of chess if you so choose.
